    "A typical way to write your network is creating a new class inherited from [Chain](https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/core/generated/chainer.Chain.html#chainer.Chain) class. When defining your model in this way, typically, all the layers which have trainable parameters are registered to the model by assigning the objects of [Link](https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/core/generated/chainer.Link.html#chainer.Link) as an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model class is instantiated before the forward and backward computations. To give input images and label vectors simply by calling the model object like a function, `__call__()` is usually defined in the model class. This method performs the forward computation of the model. Chainer uses the powerful autograd system for any computational graphs written with [Function](https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/core/generated/chainer.Function.html#chainer.Function)s and [Link](https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/core/generated/chainer.Link.html#chainer.Link)s (actually a [Link](https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/core/generated/chainer.Link.html#chainer.Link) calls a corresponding [Function](https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/core/generated/chainer.Function.html#chainer.Function) inside of it), so that you don’t need to explicitly write the code for backward computations in the model. Just prepare the data, then give it to the model. The way this works is the resulting output [Variable](https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/core/generated/chainer.Variable.html#chainer.Variable) from the forward computation has a [backward()](https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/core/generated/chainer.Variable.html#chainer.Variable.backward) method to perform autograd. In the above model, `__call__()` has a `if` statement at the end to switch its behavior by the Chainer’s running mode, i.e., training mode or not. Chainer presents the running mode as a global variable `chainer.config.train`. When it’s in training mode, `__call__()` returns the output value of the last layer as is to compute the loss later on, otherwise it returns a prediction result by calculating [softmax()](https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/generated/chainer.functions.softmax.html#chainer.functions.softmax)."

    "In the BottleNeck class, depending on the value of the proj argument supplied to the initializer, it will conditionally compute a convolutional layer `conv1x1r` which will extend the number of channels of the input `x` to be equal to the number of channels of the output of `conv1x1c`, and followed by a batch normalization layer before the final ReLU layer. Writing the building block in this way improves the re-usability of a class. It switches not only the behavior in `__class__()` by flags but also the parameter registration. In this case, when `proj` is `False`, the `BottleNeck` doesn’t have `conv1x1r` and `bn_r` layers, so the memory usage would be efficient compared to the case when it registers both anyway and just ignore them if `proj` is `False`.\n",

It turns out that VGG16 and ResNet are very useful as general feature extractors for many kinds of tasks, including but not limited to image classification. So, Chainer provides you with the pre-trained VGG16 and ResNet-50/101/152 models with a simple API. You can use these models as follows:"
